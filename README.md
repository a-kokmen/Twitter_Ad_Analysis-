# Twitter_Ad_Analysis-
Senior Project: Analysis of tweets for advertisements 


1 - Twitter4J framework to fetch tweets posted from Ankara/Turkey location.

2 - Choosing a Text-based advertisement and finding similarities between this advertisement and target users.

3 - Finding users(target group) who are interested in this advertisement.

4 - Dividing the target group in connected user clusters.

5 - Assuming that when I send advertisement to a person in each cluster, the others can see this advertisement from their cluster members' tweet.

6 - Agglomerative Clustering algorithm has been used to cluster/categorise target users and Cosine Similarity algorithm to find user similarities between user to user and user to advertisement.

PS: Check out images folder for visual tables.
